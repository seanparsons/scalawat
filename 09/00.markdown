Actors
======

In which we explore actors using [Akka](http://akka.io/).
<br />
<br />
Note to run these examples in the REPL, you'll need to include an Akka 2.0 actor jar in the classpath and pass the "-Yrepl-sync" option to the REPL.
<br />
<br />
Note that while Scala includes an actor implementation in the core library, in the future they will be replaced by Akka actors.
<br />
<br />
[The Akka Documentation](http://akka.io/docs/) is much more comprehensive than this, this is more of an introduction to what can be done.
