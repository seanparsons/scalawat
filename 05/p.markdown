Making For Comprehensions
=========================

For comprehensions work by convention, there's no requirement for them to be a collection.

* A single layer of nesting requires map to be implemented
* Multiple layers of nesting, requires map and flatMap to be implemented.
* If you want to filter items, implement filter.
* To just loop over elements, implement foreach.
